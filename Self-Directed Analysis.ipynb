There is undeniable risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt isn't that so much of what Paul said was wrong is that there is so much else that needs to be explained and that none of it can be proven.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must also be said that if it were not for the entrepreneurs not only would I not have a career but I would probably not be alive.

And I\\'m glad I clicked on the \"comment\" link, because I think a lot of people have raised important qualifications to Graham\\'s schema. Most of these qualifications point out that all those B-level operations still must get done. The fallouts are: \\r\\n\\r\\n* Individuals who do only C and never B tasks in fact defer those tasks to others. This is possible in a work environment where there is a staff to handle those B tasks -- which is an interesting conundrum given Graham\\'s argument that staff hired to handle B tasks often in fact interrupt those who work on the C tasks and hired them in the first place in order to defer the B tasks. In a home environment, B task deferment falls to a partner, whom you can only hope doesn\\'t have C tasks of their own -- I know a lot of successful academics, mostly men, who have very (*very*) patient (and forgiving and a lot of other things) wives that tend to all the B tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Individuals who only focus on C tasks, while perhaps achieving some level of greatness (and/or recognition), are often individuals who are out of balance. They are, to put it less politely than some of the commentators here have, assholes. (Again, my experience in the academy gives me plenty of examples to call upon.) So, while we may admire their achievements, it\\'s often the case (not always) that we also recognize that they are miserable human beings, and plenty of people choose a \"more mediocre\" life but one of relative happiness (however you want to define the latter term).\\r\\n\\r\\n* Sometimes A and B tasks are integral to getting C tasks done. As several posters put it, sometimes doing something else is a way of working on the C task you were \"supposed\" to be working on all along. Both the poet Wallace Stevens and the linguist Edward Sapir -- one an accountant and the other an insurance underwriter by occupation -- are reported to have gotten their best work done during long walks. So, C taskers who were occupied by B tasks who got their C tasks done while doing A tasks. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, my comment beyond my summary above is that the comments I read actually, many of which were by their own admission done as A or B level procrastination, actually made the composite essay a better one, which was one of Tim Berners-Lee\\'s desires for the web in the first place.

While Web 2.0 is clearly a buzzword, it makes sense to analyze what the new breed of web apps have in common and is better than before. It is not just Ajax, democracy and be nice to users. One thing is he misses the APIs, but I think there is a better way to describe the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially Web was about getting something out there that the whole world can use. There is one to many relationship between your site and its users. Economically the difference from old businesses is that your front desk cost now is easily available for anyone, and its cost is pretty much constant as the users grow. Your front desk is your site.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeb 2.0 is about using the network effects in your site. The more your site is used, the more beneficial it is for its users. Your site is not just a connection between you and your users, it is many-to-many connection between your users. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a lot like bringing network effects like the ones we know from instant messaging on a new platform - the Web. Why is the Web suitable for this? Because there are already acccumulated solid and general mechanisms that make the web work, and you can plug in yours more easily. If you use things like RSS, REST, JSON, etc it is also easier for others to plug in to you. This is how mashups come into play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a lot like a preexposed and generalized democracy component. Being nice to users is necessary in the context of democracy, because in such environment minor usability enhancements have compound effect to the bottom line: that\\'s why Ajax is necessary. Now that extra effort to make the site a little more useful is actually worth it. You need to enable users to be effective in your democracy, because this affects the bottom line. You need to be easily reachable, which accounts for APIs, bookmarklets, backlink tracking etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I think democracy is a misnomer: political democracy is about voting, and have the majority win. Minority doesn\\'t get what it wants. It is quite a different mechanism that works with The Long Tail: everyone should get what is suitable for him. Most Web 2.0 applications are not quite there, but clearly this is the trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S: It is an interesting thought experiment to imagine implementing a Long Tail kind of democracy politically. Neal Stephenson envisions a world of small districts with radically different laws in \"Snow Crash\". But it is not necessary to divide the laws by land (so that you must obey different laws depending on your location).

You discourage theft by making it unprofitable and personally destructive to the thieves, not by inconveniencing and annoying your customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHassling people at the door is almost *never* successful and usually at least annoys people (and in this case, it was much worse), and when you try it with someone who actually knows their rights, you get incidents like this.

It provides a good foundation in OO principles and is very easy to learn.\\r\\n\", \"It's Java here as well, but Haskell in the second semester (Germany) and nothing (well, CMOS Logic) in the third.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery funny to get an introduction to pointers with Javas Arrays ;)\", 'Personally, I would go with scheme, asm, smalltalk and maybe haskell-that way you grok S-exps/macros, hardware, objects, and types/lazy eval.  If I had to eliminate one language from that it would be smalltalk, because scheme could do the objects, but I think it is entirely reasonable to teach 4 languages in the course of a 4-year curriculum.  I read somewhere that there is a CS course somewhere in which the students do an assignment every few weeks, each time in a different language.  Anyone know where that is taught?\\r\\n\\r\\n(as an aside, I omit perl/python/ruby because they tend to be rapid uptake languages, and they are fairly popular anyway.  Better to expose the kids to something they might not see otherwise, unless you are trying to teach a vocational degree, in which case java is probably a good call, as is cobol.)', \"I think the most interesting point in the essay is that Joel wants to hire people from, eg. Duke, but is worried about doing so because it is hard to tell the Duke students who don't understand recursion because they have only coded in java from the Duke students who just aren't smart enough to recurse.  This is supposed to be part of what college is for, but since the CS depts are dropping the ball, there is a niche open for a sort of DeVry-for-cool-languages-and-techniques, where you can prove competence in scheme, haskell, asm, etc., instead of with java.  The placement rates post-graduation for such an institution would probably be excellent, assuming anyone passed.  I guess it would have to be set up like a certification or something similar, because the size of the student body would not justify a school-scale operation.  Perhaps local language organizations like LispNYC and Bothton would be the proper vehicle.\", 'A fun video, but to say he disses Java misses the point. He disses the entire state of Computer Science, Java being just one example.', \"In this article, Joel isn't putting forward an opinion on whether or not Lisp (well, Scheme, actually) is a good language for practical purposes.  He's saying that it's a good test of overall mental prowess.  Hence it's not really at all odd that he used both C and Scheme as examples; both are challenging in their own way and can be used to root out non-mediocre programmers.\", \"so we have two concepts: (1) curriculum content and (2) ways for differentiating between 'good' and 'bad' programmers in the context of an interview.  next, we've got a focus on pointers and recursion with love for c and disdain for java.  ok.  legit or not, i understand.  here's where i need help: how is recursion off limits in java?  if recursion is a concept that 'many people just never really fully comprehend,' can't we solve part of the differentiation problem by asking a java-only programmer to implement a recursive function in an interview?  the absence of pointers i get.  the absence of recursion i don't.  not being snide-- just trying to figure out if i even know what i dont know.\", 'cool... any way I can use it as a greasemonkey script(for any page with thumbnails..)?\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve asked the script author about this, he says he\\'s not familiar with the \"intricacies\" of greasemonkey, so he can\\'t tell much. any help would be welcome...this is way too good to miss out on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd is there anything else like this?', \"Recursion is crippled in java because java does not do tail-call optimization.  If you wrote some java that did this: (pardon my lack of correct java syntax)\\r\\nlength(List l, int acc)\\r\\n{  if (l.isEmpty == true)\\r\\n       return acc;\\r\\n   else\\r\\n       return length(l.next, acc + 1);\\r\\n}\\r\\nyou would eat an number of stack frames proportional to the length of the list.  If it is a circular list, you would run out of stack.  (does anyone know what java does in this case?)\\r\\nIn scheme, you would use a constant amount of stack, because  it is trivially provable that the return value of the function is just going to be passed up the stack anyway, so no new stack frames are allocated-the same one just gets recycled.  You can do this even if you have multiple functions calling one another.  Because recursion is so crippled in java relative to scheme, no one uses it in java, compared to the situation in scheme.  It's like lambda in python: it's there but so borked that it is rarely used.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think this is not an implementation issue, but rather a spec issue (ie. java is specified NOT to do tail-call optimization).  Any language lawyers in the house know the answer on that?\", '\"In general I agree. I know a thing or two about recursion but hardly anything about pointers. I\\'m a self taught programmer of seven years but I realize these deficiencies and so read books like \"Writing Great Code\" (by the inventor of High Level Assembler) and \"Database in Depth\" by C.J. Date, and thereby hope I differentiate myself from most of todays CS Grads.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you program in Java, you had damn well better understand pointers. Or rather, you had better understand Java\\'s references, which are safer than C-style pointers but which still have the same potential for problems with referential transparency and weird side-effect mazes. This is important in almost all languages; you can only truly escape it if you use a purely functional language like Haskell, and then only if you don\\'t use the special syntax for imitating side-effects with state-transition monads.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I program in Java, and there are some \"weedout\" concepts, interfaces being the one that first springs to mind. I once heard interfaces called \"architecture enablers\" and maybe that is the difference between Java and the previous languages that were taught in CS courses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou think that interfaces are a difficult concept to grasp? They just reflect the common OO practice of making similar objects support the same methods for certain purposes. They\\'re not even the best way of doing it; why doesn\\'t Java allow you to specify that some variable must implement *multiple* interfaces? Haskell\\'s type classes, which are very similar to interfaces, allow this, so it can\\'t be too difficult to type-check, and the syntax wouldn\\'t be too hard to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not having to worry about pointers allows one to more quickly get to the point of being able to \\'architect\\' a solution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGuess what? SICP, which uses Scheme as a teaching language, doesn\\'t get to anything even vaguely pointer-like until chapter 3---and there are only 5 chapters. There are plenty of other languages which have less pointer crap to worry about than Java, and are easier to learn too, so students can get into the difficult concepts faster instead of dinking around with the syntax of a for loop.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour ignorance is showing, and you don\\'t seem to realize it. Please, learn Scheme and ML. It should be an eye-opening experience for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just be sure you hire Java programmers who grok interfaces, and for heavens sake stay away from PHP coders!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAny Java programmer who doesn\\'t even understand such a simple concept as interfaces shouldn\\'t be hired, I agree. However, I fail to see the problem with PHP coders. If someone knows *only* PHP, of course they should probably be avoided, but PHP is a decent language for certain things. It\\'s also terrifically easy to learn if you already know some other languages in the C family; I picked up enough PHP in a few minutes to write a simple database-and-email script, and I\\'m not a genius.', 'He\\'s not saying that Java is bad because it can\\'t do recursion.

In fact he doesn\\'t even say that he is personally having to wade through more bad programmers, or that people shouldn\\'t use Java when they interview with him. It\\'s just the jumping off point where he observes that more people are more familiar with Java than they used to be, why this is, and what he thinks it means.', \"Let me let you in on a dirty little secret -- at MIT, the same place where we teach Scheme and 6.001 to freshmen, we teach *Java* for the upper-level, software engineering course (6.170)! Heavens!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? Because for many of the principles of software engineering: data hiding, code reuse (taking advantage of standard libraries, in particular), unit testing, it is most appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that there are those of you in the back of the classroom who snicker when you hear the phrase software engineering. You enjoy your functional language and have great disdain for Java. I bet that those of you who hold that viewpoint don't work on many software projects that are too large for you to have written yourself, or on large bodies of legacy code where half of the original authors of the codebase are now at another company, so you can no longer ask them what their code does.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you start to find yourself in this situation, it's more helpful to do defensive programming than daredevil programming. A reference shouldn't be changed or a method shouldn't be overridden? Then declare it final in Java so the new guy who is working on the codebase can't override it. You can't do that in LISP because that's not LISP's philosophy: data and code are indistinguishable so nothing is really hidden if you cdr enough times.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, there are many ways to think abstractly; certainly pointers and recursion aren't the only ones. A good interviewer should be able to discern a candidate's abilities without taking sides on his or her language preferences.\\r\\n\", 'You might be a good guy to ask this then:  what exactly IS \"software engineering\"?  If it\\'s data hiding, code reuse, and unit testing, then I don\\'t see how that is qualitatively different than developing at a repl in any language that supports functions and closures.  (Closures hide data, functions reuse code, and a repl allows you to test bits of code at a time.)  Is it just MORE of the above?  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as java being the best language for software engineering, that is an interesting statement.  I know of a bunch of very large systems written in C (too many to list), and some in C++(a lot of windows, for one), and some in various lisps (axiom, macsyma, genera, emacs), but the only 10^6 LOC thing I can think of in java is Eclipse, or maybe java itself.  Is there some other big java codebase?  And what features of java do you think make it good for s.e.?  I have been told that the package system is very nice, but never why that is so.', 'When I program in Lisp, a language noted for making widespread use of recursion, I normally do not write tail-recursive functions. (This is true to a lesser extent even in Haskell.) Most tail-recursive functions are instances of broader patterns which have already been identified and abstracted out, so I just use the abstractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place where recursion really shines, even in languages which have all the common patterns abstracted out, is in manipulation of tree data structures. This sort of code usually doesn\\'t lend itself easily to tail-call optimization, but it usually also doesn\\'t create too many stack frames.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d say that the real reasons people don\\'t use recursion as much in Java are these:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. There\\'s a widespread uneasiness about using recursion because it\\'s commonly seen as very slow and prone to stack overflows. This doesn\\'t have to be true, and in many languages it isn\\'t, but in Java there is some cost to recursion. But this isn\\'t a reason to avoid recursion in general, since the speed penalty is usually negligible.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Lots of people just don\\'t get recursion. It is with considerable scorn that I note this, since recursion seems so easy.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Recursion is often taught as a scary thing. \"Beware, my students, and have your wits about you! For today, we\\'re going to learn about a dark and scary thing called \\'recursion\\'. It\\'s slower than iterative versions, and it\\'s often hard to understand! Feeeeeeeaaaar!\"', 'He must really hate Microsoft, if he takes this effort to bash them. Wow.', 'I think he meant successful in the sense defined in \"the hundred year language\" -that a language would influence many successors.  Lisp and Algol are very successful languages in this manner, in that Algol-ish syntax has dominated pretty much all of the mainstream languages for a long time, and lisp semantics have been ported over, a tiny piece at a time, to other languages.  Java did not have much technical innovation, so it will not get the type of success that lisp did, nor will it have algol-type success, because it\\'s syntax is not all that new.  Instead it has Cobol-type success: it is used by tons of programmers to write tons of code.  Make of that what you will, but it is not the sort of success that Graham is talking about.', 'Personally, I would define software engineering as \"managing large software systems.\" And by large, I mean too big for an individual person to be completely familiar with. I didn\\'t try to claim that Java is the _best_ language for software engineering; I\\'m arguing that it has properties that make large codebases easier to manage, hence a better vehicle for teaching software engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, functions reuse code, and every language has some idea of a function, subroutine, method, what have you, but I think that the standard library that comes with Java has much more to offer than what you get with other languages. You\\'ll notice that it is quite consistent in terms of naming conventions and other things, which is impressive for a library of its size. This is code reuse on a larger scale than we see in other languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother property that helps with managing large codebases is namespaces. Without namespaces, it is difficult to produce a large codebase and be certain that there won\\'t be naming collisions if you need to make it work with another large codebase (suppose your software company acquires another one, for example -- again, this isn\\'t a problem that you and your buddies face when hacking together -- I\\'m talking about something on a larger scale than that).\\r\\n\\r\\nI concede that the REPL is a huge tool, which is why I use the DrJava plugin for Eclipse when I use Java. I hate the name, but it allows me to execute Java statements and try things out without creating a throwaway class with a main() method. ([shamelessPlug]If you\\'re a JavaScript hacker, then you may want to check out my Chickenfoot extension for Firefox, which offers something of a REPL for JavaScript, plus a lot more[/shamelessPlug].)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tools for refactoring in Java have become very good (as I said, I use Eclipse), which is also important when it comes to managing large codebases. In most languages, if you want to rename a variable in your code, then you run perl minus pie to rename it everywhere, cross your fingers, and hope that you didn\\'t break anything. With tools like Eclipse, you can do that renaming such that you know that you haven\\'t changed the behavior of your program. (Renaming a variable may be a weak example, extracting methods/interfaces are more compelling refactorings that Eclipse can do, but it\\'s not as clear what the analogue is in some other languages, which is why I used the renaming example.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not to say that such refactoring tools could not exist in other languages (in particular, functional programming languages), but I haven\\'t seen them yet. Because Java is a bit of a control freak (to the dismay of \"Real Hackers\"), creating such tools is easier to do for Java. There is certainly a fair bit of research going on to make analogous tools in other languages, but until they come to fruition, I think that teaching Java with Eclipse is a better way to teach software engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a TA for 6.170 for three semesters at MIT, and I started the movement from Emacs to Eclipse. Since Eclipse made it so easy to run unit tests and interact with CVS, which I think are also important practices for a software developer, I thought it was clearly the way to go. As you can imagine, some students/faculty thought otherwise, but that\\'s a whole different discussion.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*For the record, no student (or faculty member :) was forced to use Eclipse in 6.170: students have always been free to use whatever tools they want. You can bet that we had, and will continue to have, die-hards who insist on using Emacs and checking in their code from the command line. I\\'ve forgotten the -kb flag enough times to convince me that it isn\\'t the way to go, but that\\'s just my opinion.', \"Great reply-thanks.  \\r\\nAs to technical points-just about every package system has namespaces.  Python, perl, and Common Lisp all do.  So I think just about every language community has figured out that they are a good idea.  Heck, even scheme is adding a package system for R6RS.  Is java's different somehow?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to your experience in the 6.170-are the students allowed to use other languages, or merely other dev environments?

I guess that only leaves JavaScript without packages or namespaces, which a big pain, with respect to all the AJAX stuff going on recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of existing package/namespace systems, I can\\'t speak to all of the languages you list, but right now, I\\'m looking at the Java 1.5 API (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html), and I\\'m trying to compare it to the equivalent Python API to see how its packages are organized, but I\\'m not sure whether the Python Library Reference (http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html) is what I\\'m looking for (if this is the right site, then Python\\'s packages sure appear more disorganized than Java\\'s.) Classes in Java packages can also have data members that can be only accessed by other classes in the same package -- I\\'m not sure if the languages you list add that ability as part of their package system.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, no, 6.170 students must code in Java for 6.170. Grading student code is difficult enough as it is -- I can\\'t imagine what it would be like if we let students write in any language. Such variety would be a nightmare for our automated test suite and the other tools we use to help with grading (which are written in Python, incidentally).\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know what you mean by \"x,\" but I believe that the last language that was used for 6.170 was CLU, which is a language that was invented at MIT. It was one of the first (if not the first) languages to focus on data abstraction and I\\'m told it had nice iterators and exception handling, so I suppose this was a good choice for 6.170 back in the day. My best guess as to why they switched to Java (in the late 90s, I believe) is that it looked like Java was going somewhere and CLU wasn\\'t (which certainly turned out to be true). Because of the switch, students have been able to make some fantastic final projects since they can leverage third-party libraries written in Java, such as OpenGL, which is a lot more fun than doing a project without such libraries. I also think it\\'s important that there is at least one course in the CS curriculum that exposes students to tools that people use in the real world (CVS, Eclipse) as opposed to tools that were made for and by MIT (Edwin the Scheme editor).', 'Wow, he really seems to miss the point that Stroustrop has NEVER intended C++ as a purely object oriented language, and wouldn\\'t espouse what he\\'s saying.

C is a fairly bad assembler, as can be testified by anyone who has compiled basicly any functional language to C.  It is fairly hard to support multiple-value-return, continuations are a bit of a bear, and fast function call interfaces such as those used by Ocaml are not possible (at least, not portably).  For something to be an assembler, you would want to be able to get at the stack, which you cannot do (directly) in C.  Java is even worse as an assembler, and it gets used as an assembler sometimes.  I dearly hope that it does not become the de facto standard assembly the way C has.  It limits implementors in much the same way that semantically poor languages limit the programmer, and limiting the implementors hurts all of us.\\r\\nAs to low-level teaching languages, perhaps it would be useful to have a teaching architecture, like MMIX or the apple II or the amiga-all of them are probably understandable by a single person, and they are all a lot simpler than most current chips.

I think it depends more on figuring out what sort of work you like, and arranging your life (possibly with some sacrifices) so you get to spend more time doing it.\", 'I\\'d like to make 3 points about Paul\\'s essay:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Just because someone is able to focus on some \"great project\", I don\\'t see that, in itself, as having merit. It depends on what the outcome of the project is. Adolf Hitler was deloused at the expense of the state in 1908 and was effectively destitute at that time. However, he rose to great power following WWI. There wasn\\'t a lot of procrastination as he strove towards his big project\\'s goal. In short, there\\'s a moral aspect to what we work on.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) \"Are you working on the most important problems in your field?\". Having spent many years in scientific research myself, I have to ask the question: \"who decides what the important problems are?\". Thomas Gold was right on the money for some problems that weren\\'t even on the radar screens of his peers! Of course, he also had some spectacular misses; but my point is that few institutions tolerate men like Thomas Gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Many artists (and I include mathematicians, scientists and business people here too), successful or otherwise, are so self absorbed with themselves I find them both boring and fairly shitty people to work with, or just to be around them. Personally see some merit in, say, someone who puts the needs of his or her children first - in effect, making them \"Project 1\". Nor do I see it as inevitable that if you do so, that you cannot also be successful in other areas of your life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, I very much enjoyed Paul\\'s essay as it put some of the main issues of procrastination into stark contast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew Sheppard', 'I have read quite a few of Paul Graham\\'s essays and I have also read his book \"Hackers and Painters\". I have to say that I agree with most of what he writes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with the procrastination essay is that it seems to assume that most of us live in a world where we can choose what to do. I would love to work on the \"big problems\" in my field. I am not afraid to tackle difficult problems. The way the world works today however, it seems that only projects that have early returns are viable. If you have a lot of money and you can work on whatever you want without worrying about money, then the essay is right on. But in the real world, if you want to work on a project you have to get funding. Good luck getting funding for a \"big project\" that promises results in 10 or more years! The ones giving you the money always want results every few months. You are forced to work on small problems just to prove that you are making progress. Even in academia, you have to work on small problems so that you can write a lot of papers. People seem to think that it\\'s better if someone has written 30 \"small project\" papers than if he has written one \"large project\" paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be great if we could work on big projects, but the way corporations and academia work today, you cannot do that. You are forced to work on small projects to get results quickly in order to satisfy the ones giving you the money.', \"The author apparently missed the entire point of the essay.\\r\\n\\r\\n'Was a great Sysadmin' isn't something I want in my obituary. System administration isn't one of the great problems in CS, so why do it? The point is to do great things, not be great at doing something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd most people won't do that, so we'll have a steady supply of sysadmins :-D\", \"1&amp;3)  The point of the essay wasn't to say that focusing on a great project is a good thing to do.  Instead, he was explaining something about procrastination as it relates to working on a great project.  It also didn't say that someone who completes a great project is a good person, or even a successful one.  A general theme of Paul's writing is great projects and how to succeed at working on one.  \\r\\n\\r\\n2)  The question wasn't saying that you should conform to what your peers think important questions are.  It meant more that, if you believe that what you're working on is less important than something else you could be working on, you should be working on the more important thing.  Thomas Gold probably thought what he was working on was one of the most important problems in his field, even if his peers didn't.  Also, Paul's essay is more focused inward, at how you can improve your own progress on great projects, not that you should try to convince others to do the same.\", 'When I was a college sophomore I suffereed through an alcohol-awareness forum imposed on the students by the school administration.  Someone had conducted a survey on binge drinking and found that half the student had been on a bender in a two week period.  Their standard for \"binge drinking\" was three drinks in two hours: pathetically low.  My sense is that something similar is going on with this article.  Maybe there are new trends emerging in overall American literacy, and maybe not (this IS just one study, in a pretty soft field).  The WaPo does us a disservice by publishing the results under a headline that implicitly reads: \"Literacy of College Graduates Is On Decline:  Civilization is Doomed.\"', 'A fast, stylish, and powerful Mustang described here. Great articles and information on that site.', \"try to read a PDF on your Smart Phone - it's simply not working!\", 'A great beginners introduction to the Cheetah templating language.', \"Very nice essay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne point of further consideration is that the advice in the essay probably does not apply to children.  Children are generally right to explore many things, and not worry too much about whether they are solving the hardest problems that exist, or not.  Any problem that helps them learn, even one other people have already solved, will do.  So the child playing video games instead of working on solving public good problems in economics, or even just learning calculus, probably isn't doing anything wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne parallel is that adults, too, shouldn't worry overly about solving the hardest problems that exist, as long as they are learning and making progress.  Working on the hardest problems a person can is all we can ever ask of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it's worth considering what other parallels there are and how to unify the theories of how children and adults should look at hard problems and procrastination.\\r\\n\\r\\nElliot Temple\\r\\nhttp://www.curi.us/\", 'Without regard to your points drew, I was curious: Did you notice that it was supposed to be sarcastic?', \"This was on reddit (or maybe I sumbled on it (www.stumbleuponc.com), but I Had the same question as you...
